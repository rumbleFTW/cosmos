# Cosmos:
#### ***Cosmos is a GTK theme inspired by the darkness and depth of space. It features a sleek and minimalist design with a dark color scheme. The overall effect is one of mystery and sophistication, conveying the feeling of being adrift in the infinite expanse of the universe.***

#### This is a fork of the famous Gruvbox_GTK-theme [Link](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme)

# Installation:

- Clone the repo:
```
git clone 
```

- For GTK3, apply themes from Gnome Tweaks.
- For GTK4 applications it is only necessary to have moved the assets, gtk.css and gtk-dark.css files to the ~/.config/gtk-4.0 path, and if you notice that the theme has not been applied, just close and reopen the application.
